## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project I got to study up more on responsive mobile first css. Something that I sort of struggle with getting perfect. I do think this one turned out right but if there is anything that looks wrong or could be done better I would appreciate the feedback.

### Continued development

I would like to keep learning mobile first strategy and perfecting flex and grid more.
